a generator function does not actually run but instead immediately returns an iterator
with each call to the next built-in function, the iterator advances the generator to its next yield expression
each value passed to yield by the generator is returned by the iterator to the caller
this function is significantly easier to read because all interactions with the result list have been eliminated; results are passed to yield expressions instead
