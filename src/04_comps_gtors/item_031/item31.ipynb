    "- Beware of functions and methods that iterate over input arguments multiple times. If these arguments are iterators, you may see strange behavior and missing values.\n",
    "- Python's iterator protocol defines how containers and iterators interact with the iter and next built-in functions, for loops, and related expressions.\n",
    "- You can easily define your own iterable container type by implementing the __iter__ method as a generator.\n",
    "- You can detect that a value is an iterator (instead of a container) if calling iter on it produces the same value as what you passed in. Alternatively, you can use the isinstance built-in function along with the collections.abc.Iterator class.  \n"
