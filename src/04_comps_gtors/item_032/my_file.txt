Item 32 Consider Generator Expressions for Large List Comprehensions

Things to Remember
- List comprehensions can cause problems for large inputs by using too much memory.
- Generator expressions avoid memory issues by producing outputs one at a time as iterators.
- Generator expressions can be composed by passing the iterator from one generator expression into the for subexpression of another.
- Generator expressions execute very quickly when chained together and are memory efficient.
